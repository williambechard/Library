# Digital University Capstone Project

This is a monorepo containing the frontend and GraphQL API code for the Digital U Capstone Project. This project is a library book management system, built to closely emulate the structure of the Digital University codebase. The frontend is built with React, Next.js, Apollo Client, Digital UI, and Emotion. The API is built with GraphQL and Apollo server 4. Both projects target node 16.

## Getting Started

Before you can start development, you will need to initialize a git repo locally with `git init`.

Once you have a repo locally, you will need to create a remote repo in Github: https://github.com

After you create the repo in github, connect your local repo to the remote repo. There are instructions on how to do this in github.

To get started, cd into either the frontend or api directory, run `npm i`, then run `npm run dev`. For the frontend this will fire up the next app and expose it locally at http://localhost:3000. For the backend it will start up the Apollo Server and expose it at http://localhost:4000.

For more details, check out the READMEs inside the api and frontend directories.
